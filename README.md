# blur_lock
small shell script for blur lock

That is a script when I started to use i3blurlock-blabla, to have more customization opportunities (It was probably i3lock-color, but not sure.).
Therefore, it is a small custom bash script that has three(3) modes: start, home and outside. 

Modes:
start: you can just select a wallpaper to use as a login screen.
home: blurs the current screen and puts a png file onto it.
outside: just blurs the current screen and uses as a locker.

Sample usage:

sh ./blur_lock.sh {mod} {png file] {location} {geometry}


location as default: Center
geometry as default: -20x1200
